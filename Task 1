Task 1: Calculate Area with Conditions
Write a Python function calculate_area that takes two parameters: length and width. It
should calculate and return the area of a rectangle. However, add a condition: if the length
is equal to the width, return "This is a square!" instead of the area. Then, write a program to
input values for length and width from the user and call the calculate_area function to
display either the area or the message.


def calculate_area(length, width):
    if length == width:
        return "This is a square!"
    else:
        return length * width

def main():
    length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width: "))
    
    result = calculate_area(length, width)
    print("Area:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
